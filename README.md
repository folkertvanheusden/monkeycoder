This program was written to understand the problem of generating code with a genetic algorithm.

Usage: create a json with the input and output values for which you want a program or try one
of the examples that is generated with the 'gen\_example\_json.py'-script.:

    python3 monkeycoder.py -t shift-n.json -s state.dat -l monkeycoder.log -c 4 -v

-t: input script

-s: state-file, in case you need to prematurely stop the program and want to continue at some other time

-l: logfile

-c: number of threads

-v: enable verbose mode
